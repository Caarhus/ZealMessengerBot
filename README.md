# One Solution.  One Bot

The main idea behind Zeal is rethinking the way we establish reminders. With a simple interface, Zeal functions as a bot whose sole goal is to assist in aiming for the completion of the user’s goals. Zeal will handle reminders in a unique way. It will offer location based reminders, as well as scanning user’s social calendars and such, with the use of various API’s. With a completely rebuilt way of using prioritized reminders, Zeal will make sure the user gets their tasks completed.
